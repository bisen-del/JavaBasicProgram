//Each Christmas, the members of the royal family exchange gifts with each other. The family has n members numbered from 1 to n. However, not everyone in the family gives and receives the same number of gifts.

// The youngest member receives a gift from everyone else in the family except himself but does not give any gifts to anyone else. This Christmas, there were a total of m gifts that were exchanged among the family members. You are provided with the data for all m gifts. Find the number that represents the youngest family member using the given data.

// Input Format
// The first line of the input contains two integers n and m â€“ the number of family members and the number of gifts that were exchanged.
// The next m lines contain two integers each. In the ith line, two integers ai, bi represent that a gift was given by ai to bi.
// Note: any ordered pair (ai, bi) will not occur more than once, i.e., a family member does not give more than one gift to the same member.
// Testcase Input
// 2 1
// 1 2
// Testcase Output
// 2
